<h4>2 _____ memory and decay</h4>

<p>a website that denatures and decays, housing memories that people can submit anonymously; submissions disappear/deteriorate over a certain length of time; website could also be a good way to be part of the discussion around green hosting + the cost &amp; precise heaviness of the web (see Sanctuary Computer, <a href="https://negative.sanctuary.computer/">https://negative.sanctuary.computer/</a>). for people who look for a void to type their feelings into, people who journal, a sentimental person</p>

<p>inspired by <a href="http://letterstocrushes.com/">http://letterstocrushes.com/</a></p>

<h4>2 _____ weird wustl energy</h4>

<p>website about Paul McKee&#39;s real estate properties + that uneasy feeling of being complicit in what WashU proper does — for WashU students who feel similarly and students in similar private universities — to chronicle a history, include reflections and insight, and share organizations and people doing the work</p>

<h4>3 _____ emotion, identity, socmed</h4>

<p>website/book about emotion and affect in TikTok and Youtube. could have connections to reaction culture, emojis, digital avatars, modes of identity formation</p>

<p>this is a very specific topic but it could branch out for the type of person who enjoys watching and discussing <em>Black Mirror</em>, is familiar with TT/IG, likely late teens and upwards</p>

<p>to expand on this topic with a series of texts and imagery, some kind of experience that maybe could get at the onslaught of media that carries out emotional whiplash ceaslessly</p>
