			<p class="timestamp">Feb 10, 2022 Thursday</p>
			<p>
				Around 5 months ago I started building my reference repository for my capstone project. Around this time I’d been thinking about <a href="https://tdingsun.github.io/worlding/">worlding</a>, tooling, aspect ratios and media formats, and interfaces. In May I completed a film seminar that had influenced my thinking a lot; it was this class that pushed me to follow media theory more. Specifically, I started revisiting childhood themes: casual/restaurant management/food-based games, escaping the drudgery of the office cubicle, forms of comfort—whether it be through cuteness or something else.
			</p>
			<p>
				Taking Aggie's <em>Semiotics Studio</em> also grew my interest in design writing with a more personal twist. I was interested in analyzing the implications of decontextualized mockups, the idea of whiteness in digital design, and complicating my own personal aesthetic taste. Collecting visual references for the repository was aspirational: many of the blocks in the channel have a kind of fluidity to them, a tactile, hand-manipulated look and feel. I was interested in something striking, something that blurred the analog and digital.
			</p>
			<p>
				During the fully remote school year I’d become interested in political Instagram and online political communities. With January 6, 2021 this heightened and I became especially invested in the feeling of making something conspiratorial. Developing an ARG that was mass-available, however, was something beyond my scope. But the visuals lingered: a reoccurring symmetry and suggestion of divine proportions paired nicely with then-louder calls to rethink Western (Euro/Amerocentric) graphic design. Throughout this time I began feverishly collecting images about interface design and interface metaphors.
			</p>
			<p>
				Thinking back on my time here at this university, I’ve been able to test out the waters through an anthropology class, another in comparative literature, and a few programming-heavy design courses. I enjoy this idea of a remixed, hodgepodge design practice, snagging pieces of code, graphic styles here and there. (Maybe it’s the resourcefulness that I like to think I’ve developed.) Taking <a href="http://coopertype.org/event/generative_type_fall2020">Generative Type</a> with Lynne and Kevin in the summer of 2020 was also especially important in this journey.
			</p>
			<p>
				And so my initial ideas for this capstone were quite ambitious. I was thinking about connection and solitude online, having read Venkatesh Rao's <a href="https://studio.ribbonfarm.com/p/digital-homelessness">“Digital Homelessness”</a>; I wanted to recreate/interpret the feeling of passing by someone and sharing a brief moment of connection. This was also around the moment when I was really getting into David Jay’s talks about asexuality and reconsidering (new) forms of intimacy, how we approach relationships.
			</p>
			<p>
				More themes of personal interest started emerging: <a href="https://www.are.na/block/8506022">mythology and belonging</a>, <a href="https://www.are.na/block/6032861">dad bod web design</a> (as Stephanie Kwak <a href="https://www.are.na/stephanie-kwak/dad-bod-web-design">describes it</a>), <a href="https://www.are.na/block/13645110">earnest cakes</a> and chunky, <a href="https://www.are.na/block/14615367">handmade jewelry</a> that’s tender and tough, <a href="https://www.are.na/block/13048670">advertising</a>, <a href="https://www.are.na/block/12684621"><em>Superstore</em> interstitials</a>. And around 3 months ago, I revisited a favorite <a href="https://www.are.na/block/14114954">cooking video</a> that I’d first seen from a different YouTuber and started sketching out ideas relating to sad/struggle meals and cringe online. What is it about <a href="https://youtu.be/Xtrsh4U_GCY">these foods</a> that evoke such pathos? And was this pathos unique to the web?
			</p>
			<p>
				(This progression is evident in the descriptions: [<a href="https://www.are.na/block/13256325">week 1–3</a>] > [<a href="https://www.are.na/block/13557594">week 4–6</a>] > [<a href="https://www.are.na/block/13781724">week 7–8</a>] > [<a href="https://www.are.na/block/13862508">week 9</a>]. It drops off at week 10, but honestly I’m still struggling with many of these questions/notes still.)
			</p>
			<p>
				At week 9 I mention a sad feeling I get from TV dinners, but researching this further it feels like I’m referring to the role of class, and more specifically methods of meal prep being linked to socioeconomic status. I turned in my proposal late-November and from there, I’ve been trying to narrow my scope and manage my expectations.
